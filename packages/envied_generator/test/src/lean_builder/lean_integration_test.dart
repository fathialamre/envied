// Integration tests for LeanEnviedBuilder
//
// These tests would require a full lean_builder test harness similar to
// source_gen_test used by the existing generator tests. Since lean_builder
// is still in active development and its testing utilities are evolving,
// these integration tests are placeholders for future implementation.
//
// For now, the lean builder has been tested manually with the examples in:
// - examples/envied_lean_example/
//
// Future work should include:
// 1. Setting up lean_builder test infrastructure
// 2. Creating test fixtures with @Envied annotations
// 3. Running the builder and verifying generated output
// 4. Testing all feature combinations (obfuscate, nullable, multi-env, etc.)
